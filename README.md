# Task:

Many​ ​of​ ​us​ ​are​ ​avid​ ​foosball​ ​players,​ ​but​ ​running​ ​around​ ​the​ ​office​ ​to​ ​form​ ​teams​ ​is​ ​both​ ​tiring and​ ​wastes​ ​lots​ ​of​ ​our​ ​precious​ ​time.​ ​Therefore,​ ​we​ ​would​ ​appreciate​ ​a​ ​bit​ ​of​ ​help​ ​with​ ​this.​ ​This task​ ​is​ ​about​ ​making​ ​a​ ​tool​ ​that​ ​would​ ​enable​ ​us​ ​to​ ​organise​ ​players​ ​and​ ​maybe​ ​even​ ​track some​ ​statistics​  ​-​ ​essentially,​ ​getting​ ​a​ ​game​ ​started​ ​without​ ​moving​ ​our​ ​bottoms​ ​from ​our​ ​comfy chairs.​ ​Who​ ​knows,​ ​if​ ​things​ ​go​ ​well​ ​you​ ​might​ ​get​ ​to​ ​use​ ​it​ ​too!

 At a minimum, the​ ​app​ should ​allow​ ​us​ ​to​ ​access​ ​a​ player list and​ ​create​ ​a​ ​game​ ​where​ ​you​ ​invite others​. If you want to and have enough time you can add bonus features: ​players’​ ​details view, ​rearranging ​teams​ or,​ ​after​ ​a​ ​match,​ ​add​ing and storing ​some​ ​stats.

 We​ ​ask​ ​you​ ​not​ ​to​ ​spend​ ​​more​ ​than​ ​4​ ​hours​​ ​for​ ​this​ ​task.​ Don't worry if ​you​ ​don’t​ ​manage​ ​to​ ​implement a gazillion of features or breathtaking design -​ focus on the create game and lobby functionalities. We'll appreciate clean elegant code, a thoughtful solution and a nice project structure!
 
 # The​ ​functionality
 - Player List
 - Create​ ​a​ ​game 
    - Invite​ ​players


## Optional
- Rearrange​ ​teams​ ​by​ ​reassigning​ ​players 
- Detailed​ ​player​ ​view
- Add​ ​some​ ​stats​ ​to​ ​each​ ​player
- Login​ ​(can​ ​be​ ​mocked)
- Visually​ ​pleasing​ ​design​ ​and​ ​interactions, responsiveness

## Expected​ language
- JS​ ​(ES6)  
- A​ ​framework​ ​(​Angular, React, or any other popular framework)

But in general we want you to take advantage of tools you know and like to use.

## Assets​ ​provided 
- Players’​ ​photos 
- ​JSON​ ​with​ ​players’​ ​details 
- Wireframes representing an example implementation 

## Expected​ ​outcome 
- a project ​repository​ with a solution
 
Good luck! :)



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
